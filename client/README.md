This program was originally written with vanilla JS and PHP, no frameworks front or back. To see this version in action, click:

This current version is far from complete. Only the frist part, getting the email address(es) to send to, which template to send, and checkboxes to edit the code within the template. That's all. No real functionality yet EXCEPT the dropdown menus are VERY customized for this program. Selecting multiple email addresses is a new addition.
