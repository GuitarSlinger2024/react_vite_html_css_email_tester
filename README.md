This is meant to be a way to send HTML CSS email by first previewing them in the app, then by sending them to one or more email address so you can look at what is actually send. The github repo for this can be found at:

This project is not done yet. To see a working version that uses vanilla JS & php, go here:

The new version uses React, with express for the server-side, and so far has only one great new feature. With this version bulk emails can be stored, with any/all of them being selected for any mailing. This means it not only helps to preview the emails, it is also a great way to store email addresses in a dropdown mailing list.
